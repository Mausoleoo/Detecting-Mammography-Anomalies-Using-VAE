# Detecting-Mammography-Anomalies-Using-VAE
 A Variational Autoencoder was used to detect anomalies in breast mammographies. Trained on healthy breast images, with ELBO as the loss function and a latent space of 1024, the model identifies anomalies when the reconstruction error exceeds the average. It also generates realistic images of healthy breasts.
